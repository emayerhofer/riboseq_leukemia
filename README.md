# Ribo-Seq analysis from rare leukemia cells
This is the code accompanying the paper "**A Streamlined Protocol for Ribosome Protected Fragment Isolation from rare leukemia cell populations**" by Mayerhofer & Mayerhofer et al.

process_rpf.sh should be run for Ribosome Protected Fragment fastq files (single-end, R1 only) and process_transcriptome should be run for the Transcriptome files (paired end, R1 + R2 files).
Please change the input parameters in the header of the files accordingly to your needs.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to ernst.mayerhofer@gmail.com.
